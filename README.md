### Hi there!

I'm an attorney and an aspiring cyber security professional, specifically with an interest in compliance, living in San Francsico, California.

Some recent updates:
- I recently finished the 2023 WiCyS + ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity Certification Summer Camp and successfully earned my ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity Certificate.
- I am currently in the second round cohort of the WiCys Security Training Scholarship to help deepen my technical skills.
- I'm currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ exam and will be sitting for the examination in October 2023.
