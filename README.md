### Welcome!

I'm an aspiring cyber security analyst specifically with an interest in compliance living in San Francsico, California.

I recently finished the 2023 WiCyS + ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity Certification Summer Camp and successfully earned my ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity Certificate.

I'm currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ exam and anticipate taking it in September 2023.
